/* 
 * Java Collection Interface
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html
 * 
 * Reduces programming effort: by providing data structures and algorithms so you don't have to write them yourself.
 * Increases performance: by providing high-performance implementations of data structures and algorithms. Because the various implementations of each interface are interchangeable, programs can be tuned by switching implementations.
 * Provides interoperability between unrelated APIs: by establishing a common language to pass collections back and forth.
 * Reduces the effort required to learn APIs: by requiring you to learn multiple ad hoc collection APIs.
 * Reduces the effort required to design and implement APIs: by not requiring you to produce ad hoc collections APIs.
 * Fosters software reuse: by providing a standard interface for collections and algorithms with which to manipulate them.
 */
/* - 4 interfaces: Set, List, Map, Deque
 * - The general-purpose implementations support all of the optional operations in the collection interfaces and have no restrictions on the elements they may contain
 * - They are unsynchronized, but the Collections class contains static factories called synchronization wrappers that can be used to add synchronization to many unsynchronized collections
