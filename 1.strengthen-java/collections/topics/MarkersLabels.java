- Lists that support fast (generally constant time) indexed element access are known as random access lists.
- Lists that do not support fast indexed element access are known as sequential access lists.
- The RandomAccess marker interface enables lists to advertise the fact that they support random access.

=>This enables generic algorithms to change their behavior to provide good performance when applied to either random or sequential access lists.
